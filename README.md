## Project Summary

Most of us can relate to kicking back on the couch and enjoying a movie with friends and family.
Popular Movies helps users discover popular and highly rated movies on the web. It displays a scrolling grid of movie trailers, 
launches a details screen whenever a particular movie is selected, allows users to save favorites, play trailers, and read user reviews.
